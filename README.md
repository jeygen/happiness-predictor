# happiness-predictor

The happiness-predictor is a lighthearted application that predicts the user's current happiness. By combining </br>
the user's local weather, the price of bitcoin, and cultural sentiment, a score between -1 (bad) and 1 (good) is </br>
calculated by a state-of-the-art algorithm. The scores and time are saved in a local database, as well as a local </br>
csv file. The gui has the option to view a plot of the most recent entries, delete the save files, calculate the </br>
user's happiness score, or exit the program. </br>
