# happiness-predictor

## Overview
  
  Unsure how you're feeling? Out of touch with your inner self? Look no further than the happiness-predictor!

  The happiness-predictor is a lighthearted application that predicts the user's current happiness. By combining </br>
the user's local weather, the price of bitcoin, and cultural sentiment, a score between -1 (bad) and 1 (good) is </br>
calculated by a state-of-the-art algorithm. The scores and time are saved in a local database, as well as a local </br>
csv file. The gui has the option to view a plot of the most recent entries, delete the save files, calculate the </br>
user's happiness score, or exit the program. </br>

  This project is an excercise in familiarizing myself with the basics of web scraping, interacting with APIs, </br>
frontend creation, saving/deleting/retrieving data, natural languaging processing, and data visualization. The </br>
location, weather, and bitcoin price are an excercise in APIs. The New York Times and a randomly selected poem </br>
are used to practice web scraping scraping and language processing. The gui is frontend practice and the backend </br>
is an excercise in CRUD. 

## Getting Started
